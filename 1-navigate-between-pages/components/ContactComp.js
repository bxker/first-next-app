          <h1>About Allen ISD</h1>
          <p>
            The Allen Independent School District serves the rapidly growing
            city of Allen, Texas, a suburban community located 23 miles north of
            Dallas. Student enrollment has more than doubled since 1989,
            bringing the current number of students to more than 20,780 in
            grades K-12. Students attend one of 18 elementary schools, three
            middle schools, one freshman center and one high school.
          </p>
          <h1>Enrollment Increases</h1>
          <p>
            Allen ISD enrollment has grown steadily since the early 1990s. The
            district is currently growing at a rate of about four percent.
            Regardless of enrollment increases, Allen ISD is committed to
            maintaining acceptable student-to-staff ratios and class sizes
            through the hiring of additional staff or the distribution of
            students to "sister" campuses if necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elementary students enrolling in Allen ISD for the first time may be
            assigned to a school outside of their attendance area if no space
            exists in their grade level.{' '}
